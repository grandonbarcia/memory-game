# Memory Game

A fun memory game where users can test their memory skills with themselves or with friends. Users can customize their gaming experience by choosing between numbers or icons as the matching elements. The game allows further personalization by offering grid size options, with players selecting either a classic 4 by 4 grid for a quick challenge or a more intricate 6 by 6 grid for a heightened level of difficulty.

## Motivation

I never made a traditional game before, so I wanted to challenge myself to make a game that was simple like tic-tac-toe but a little more complex.
